## Installation

### Prerequisites
You will need Python 3 (3.7 or greater is recommended) along with the equivalent virtualenv and pip packages.

On Ubuntu, you can install them using the following command:
```
# apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

### Installation on Linux/WSL
Run the init.sh script which will automatically create the virtualenv and install the required pip dependencies.
Please refer to this file for the pip dependencies
```
$ bash ./init.sh
```
## Usage
The server can now be started using the start.sh script:
```
$ bash ./start.sh ./
```
The key combination CTRL + C can be used to stop the server.
